## About The Project

The project is to develop a game using OpenGL, ImGUI, glm, and other libraries. I haven't figured out what the game will be about yet, and I'm not even sure if I can handle 3D or if I'll keep it in 2D. For now, I'm writing a base to simplify its further development, so I'll definitely change this later.

## Getting Started

Here's how to build a project (so far it's easiest under Linux) and run the game.

### Prerequisites

First you need to install some things.

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install -y cmake g++ libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev
  ```

### Build

For a Linux build, just write this:

```sh
  ./run.sh
```
